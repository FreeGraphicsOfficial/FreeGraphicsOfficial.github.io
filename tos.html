            <p>The information provided when using the Services is not intended for distribution to or use by any person or entity in any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation or which would subject us to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country. Accordingly, those persons who choose to access the Services from other locations do so on their own initiative and are solely responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable.</p>
            <p>Scope of Services: The Company offers custom graphic design services, including but not limited to logos, banners, social media graphics, and website designs. The specific details of the services to be rendered will be agreed upon in writing between the Company and the Customer prior to commencement of work.</p>
            <p>Design Process: The Company will initiate the design process based on the brief provided by the Customer. The brief must contain clear instructions and preferences regarding the desired outcome of the project. The Company will present initial concepts to the Customer within a mutually agreed timeframe. The Customer is entitled to request revisions within the scope of the original brief.</p>
            <p>Revisions and Final Approval: The Company allows for a reasonable number of revisions to ensure customer satisfaction. However, excessive or unreasonable revision requests may incur additional charges. Once the final design is approved by the Customer, no further changes will be made unless agreed upon in writing. The approval signifies the Customer's acceptance of the design as completed.</p>
            <p>Delivery and Format: Upon final approval, the Company will deliver the finished design to the Customer in the agreed-upon file formats and resolutions suitable for the intended use. The Company guarantees the quality and usability of the delivered files but does not assume responsibility for the compatibility of the files with software or platforms not disclosed during the briefing phase.</p>
            <p>Intellectual Property Rights: The Company retains all rights to the preliminary designs and concepts presented during the design process until final payment is received. Upon receipt of full payment, the Company transfers exclusive rights to the final design to the Customer, excluding the right to resell the design as the Customer's own work.</p>
            <p>Confidentiality: Both parties agree to maintain confidentiality regarding the details of the project, including but not limited to the design brief, concepts, and final design, until the project is publicly launched or disclosed by mutual agreement.</p>
            <p>Termination and Cancellation: Either party may terminate the project with written notice. In the event of termination by the Customer, the Company reserves the right to retain a portion of the fees paid as compensation for work performed up to the point of cancellation.</p>
            <p>Dispute Resolution: Any disputes arising from this Agreement will be resolved through negotiation. If negotiations fail, the dispute will be submitted to arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association.</p>
            <p>Governing Law: This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, USA, without regard to its conflict of laws principles.</p>
            <p>Acceptance of Terms: By engaging the Company for graphic design services, the Customer acknowledges and agrees to the terms and conditions set forth in this Industry-Specific Clause.</p>
