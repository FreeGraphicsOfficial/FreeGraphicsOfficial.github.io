Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile information about you from your social media provider. The profile information we receive may vary depending on the social media provider concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends list, and profile picture, as well as other information you choose to make public on such a social media platform.</p>
            <p>We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this privacy notice or that are otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Services. Please note that we do not control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your third-party social media provider.

            <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 13 years of age or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent's use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 13 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under the age of 13, please contact us at <a href="crypticdevelopernetwork+FG-childsaftey@gmail.com">crypticdevelopernetwork+FG-childsaftey@gmail.com</a>.</p>

            <h2 id="privacy-rights">9. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>

            <p>Withdrawing your consent: If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section <a href="#contact">"HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?"</a> below.</p>
            <p>However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</p>
            <h3>Account Information</h3>
            <p>If you would at any time like to review or change the information in your account or terminate your account, you can contact us with the email in the <a href="#contact">HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?</a> section.</p>

            <h2 id="dnt">10. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
            <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>

            <h2 id="notice-updates">11. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE?</h2>

If we make material changes to this privacy notice, we may notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to review this privacy notice frequently to be informed of how we are protecting your information.</p>
